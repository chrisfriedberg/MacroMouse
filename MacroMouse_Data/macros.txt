# Icon Files - PNGs
When creating a PNG for a later ICO version:

1.  Do not make the back ground the same color as the foreground.  This will allow me to remove the BG using transparency tools. 
If you leave it in, it will completely remove everything of or near that color.

2.  Do not leave padding on the inside edges. Use the full square space to allow for a larger ico when it's converted to an ICO file.
